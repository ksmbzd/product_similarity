# Product Similarity Project

## Overview
This project aims to identify similar products within a dataset of images by leveraging advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques. Using pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and similarity comparison algorithms, the project can compare product images to find matches or closely related items.

## Features
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizes a pre-trained CNN model to extract detailed features from product images.
- **Similarity Comparison**: Implements similarity metrics to compare extracted features and identify similar products.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Incorporates options for fine-tuning, data augmentation, and employing metric learning approaches for improved accuracy.
